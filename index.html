         <img src="lifeBalance.png" alt="image life balance" width="400px" height="400px">
         <figcaption>I think becoming a programmer is a way to use all my strengths and finally find a work-life balance.  That's what I like most about programming - it's an unlimited amount of what you can learn, you can change the path of your career and do what you're really interested in. And no longer spend your life at work, but consider work a part of your life.</figcaption>
